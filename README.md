# Image-Classification
The focus of this project is to identify different forms of chest cancer using CNN's. There are four kind of images:
*Normal cells
*Adenocarcinoma
*Large cell carcinoma
*Squamous cell carcinoma

The dataset has the following amount of images:
*Training set: 613.
*Validation set: 315.
*Test set: 72.

## Goal
The goal is to obtain a model which can separate healthy from sick patients and that can also distinguish between the types of sicknesses. Since training a CNN from scratch usually requires a lot more data than is present, a already exiting model will be used for the classifications. The model that is used is Resnet50.
